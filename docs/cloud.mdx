constraints.txt has httpx==0.28.1.

The correct commands for cloud are:
make -f Makefile.poetry lock
make -f Makefile.poetry constraints
make -f Makefile.pipx pip-install-constrained

Or in one step:
make -f Makefile.poetry constraints-lock
make -f Makefile.pipx pip-install-constrained

Also verify after install:
pip show httpx | grep Version
Should show Version: 0.28.1

If it's still showing an older version, you may need to:
pip install --upgrade httpx==0.28.1

Or force reinstall with constraints:
pip install -c constraints.txt --force-reinstall httpx
